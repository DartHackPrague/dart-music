dart-music
==========
A simple music visualisation created in Dart and HTML 5. (Currently <audio> is not working in Dartium, so you have to compile all scripts to JavaScript.)

You can Drag and Drop your own mp3 file to play it instead of sample track.
By selecting a part of frequency chart, you can filter different frequencies in real time (only selected frequencies will be played).


Canvas tag is used for animations and HTML5 audio API for reading live audio from played track.
